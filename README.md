# JavaScript Fundamentals Starter

This project contains a simple starter setup to practice JavaScript fundamentals. Follow the instructions below to learn and practice the basics of JavaScript.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and open it in your code editor.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to load the starter page.
3. Open the browser DevTools console to see output and test your code.
4. Write your code in `index.js` and reload the page to see the results.

## Exercises

Below are a series of exercises to guide you through core JavaScript concepts. Work through them in order. Write your code in `index.js`, and check the console or the page output as instructed.

### 1. Hello World

- In `index.js`, log "Hello, World!" to the console or page.
- Reload the page and verify you see the message.

### 2. Variables and Data Types

- Declare variables using `let`, `const`, and `var`.
- Store values of different data types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, object).
- Log each variable and its type to the console or page.

### 3. Operators

- Write examples of arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
- Demonstrate comparison operators (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `<`, `>`).
- Log the results.

### 4. Control Flow

- Write an `if...else` statement that checks a variable value and logs a message.
- Write a `switch` statement that handles multiple cases and logs a message.

### 5. Loops

- Practice `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops.
- Use loops to iterate over an array and log elements.

### 6. Functions

- Define a named function and an arrow function.
- Have functions accept parameters and return values.
- Invoke your functions and log their results.

### 7. Arrays and Objects

- Create an array of items and log its length.
- Create an object with properties and methods.
- Access and update properties, and call methods.

### 8. DOM Manipulation

- Select DOM elements using `document.getElementById` or `querySelector`.
- Change element content or style.
- Create and append new elements.

### 9. Events

- Add an event listener to a button or element (e.g., `click`).
- In the event handler, modify the DOM or log a message.

## Next Steps

- Explore more advanced topics: ES6+, asynchronous JavaScript, APIs, and frameworks.
- Build small projects to reinforce your learning.

Good luck, and enjoy coding!
